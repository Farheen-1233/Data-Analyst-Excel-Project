# Employee Sales Performance Dashboard
## Project Objective
To analyze and visualize the sales performance of individual sales executives across different regions. The dashboard aims to identify top performers and those falling short of targets, helping management take data-driven actions to improve efficiency and output.
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs are tracked to evaluate employee performance:
KPI Name	Description
	
Total Sales	  Total units sold by each executive over a period of 5 days.
Daily Sales (Day1–Day5)	Sales performance per day to identify consistency and trends.
Target	The fixed sales benchmark set for each executive (500 units in this case).
Target Hit %	Percentage of the target achieved by the employee.
Away From Target %	The shortfall percentage of the employee compared to the target.
## Key Insights from the Dashboard
1.	Top Performers Identified:
o	Executives with Target Hit % > 75% are considered high performers.
o	E.g., Arvind Sharma has achieved 75.8%, making him a leading contributor.
2.	Underperformers Highlighted:
o	Executives with Target Hit % < 50% are not meeting expectations.
o	E.g., Anuj Sharma and Tanuja Kale have hit only 42.6% and 47.8%, respectively.
3.	Daily Performance Trends:
o	Certain days (like Day 2 and Day 3) show higher sales activity, suggesting a trend in customer engagement or team effort.
4.	Regional Comparison:
o	The dashboard allows regional segmentation, which helps identify regional patterns or challenges.
5.	Visual Clarity:
o	Through charts and conditional formatting, performance gaps and achievements are easily visible at a glance.
## Final Conclusion
The dashboard successfully captures employee-level sales performance in a clear and structured format. It helps identify who is achieving targets and who needs attention or support. By using KPIs like Target Hit % and Away From Target %, the organization can track sales effectiveness, reward high performers, and devise training or support mechanisms for underperformers.
This tool can support decision-making in performance appraisals, incentive distributions, and training needs assessment, ultimately contributing to improved sales productivity across the team.
